Done. One-time macOS steps if this is a fresh machine:
  1. Grant OmniWM     System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility (required) and Input Monitoring (swipes)
  2. Karabiner-Elements: approve its driver extension + Input Monitoring
     when prompted (System Settings -> Privacy & Security)
  3. Korren isn't in the Brewfile — build it from the korren repo:
       ./packaging/macos/build-app.sh --install

Super = hold Caps Lock. Switch themes:  theme-set <name>  or  Super+Shift+T
Back to a normal Mac any time:  ./uninstall.sh
