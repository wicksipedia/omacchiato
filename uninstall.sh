Done. Left in place on purpose:
  - Homebrew packages you already had before omacosy (manifest-tracked;
    without a manifest, all packages stay — remove manually)
  - Karabiner's Caps Lock remap stops once the app is quit/uninstalled.
  - The menu bar returns fully after logging out and back in.
  - Claude desktop's caps-lock dictation shortcut was removed during setup;
    re-enable it in Claude's settings if you used it.
  - If OmniWM still appears in System Settings -> General -> Login Items,
    remove it there.
  - OmniWM.app is a brew cask like the rest: removed above only when the
    manifest says omacosy installed it; one that predates omacosy stays.
  - Permission entries (Accessibility, Input Monitoring, Screen Recording,
    Location, Bluetooth) stay listed in System Settings -> Privacy &
    Security — macOS lets no script remove them. The binaries they named
    are gone, so the entries are inert; delete them there if you want the
    lists clean.
  - The repo itself and your shell tools (fzf, eza, zoxide, ...) are untouched.
